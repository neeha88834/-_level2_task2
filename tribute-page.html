          “I am not a perfectionist, but I like to feel that things are done well. More important than that, I feel
          an endless need to learn, to improve, to evolve, not only to please the coach and the fans, but also to
          feel satisfied with myself. It is my conviction that here are no limits to learning, and that it can
          never stop, no matter what our age.”
